# Frontend Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HardikDaim/rbac-frontend.git
cd rbac-frontend
```
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables
In the root of the frontend project, create a .env file and add the following environment variable:
```bash
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```
This URL points to the backend API.

### 4. Run the Application
